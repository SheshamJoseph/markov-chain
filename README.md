# Markov Chain Text Generator

This project implements a Markov Chain-based text generator in C++. It reads a text file, learns word transitions, and generates text based on a given starting word. The project initially supports **word-based predictions** and will be improved to support **n-grams**.

## Features
- Reads input text files and builds a transition matrix.
- Generates text based on probabilities of word transitions.
- Supports user input for file path and starting word.
- **N-gram support** for better predictions.
-  Command-line argument parsing
